# Introduction

Here we provide the code for reproducing results for Natural-Questions. 


## Reproduction

The procedure is the same as MS-MARCO with different [DPTDR RoBERTa-Large](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D61_BOzlRorJdLlgDC3cCsEZe0XymlCW/view?usp=sharing). We also provide our trained models in [retriever_model_s2.lr7e-3.nepochs10.psl128.prefix](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jzI40hntWZRLP6xgQ-ys7nfNcvmcTI7b/view?usp=sharing)

For evaluation, please refer to [coCondenser repo](https://github.com/luyug/Dense/tree/main/examples/wikipedia-nq) as we completely followed its evaluation steps.
